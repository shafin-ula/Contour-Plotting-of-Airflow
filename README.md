# Contour Plotting of Airflow Simulation

Simulation of the AirFlow through a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, which predicts using simulations and given parameters the airflow over a car.

Simulation Code measures vertical air velocity at each node along with the pressure generated at each node. Streamlines which indicate smooth flow of the air is also plotted.
